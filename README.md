## What is needed for this Project:
- DHT 11 sensor
- Adafruit SSD1306 display
- ESP2866F Module
- some cables
- a Breadboard
- a 10k Ohm Resistor (There is a version of the DHT11 sensor that doesn't need a resistor)
-  http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json

## Dependencies:
- DHT Sensor Library
- Adafruit BusIO
- Adafruit GFX Library
- Adafruit SSD1306
- Adafruit Unified Sensor
